# Enhanced OMR System - Multiple Correct Answers Support

## 🎯 Overview

The OMR (Optical Mark Recognition) system has been enhanced to support questions with multiple correct answers, improved marking detection, and better accuracy for various marking styles.

## 📋 Key Features

### ✅ Multiple Correct Answers
- Support questions where multiple options can be correct (e.g., Q2: A,C or Q4: D,E)
- Partial credit scoring for partially correct answers
- Backward compatibility with single correct answer questions

### 🔍 Enhanced Detection
The system can now detect various marking styles:
- **Filled circles** - Traditional bubble filling
- **Marks above options** - Checkmarks or marks placed above A, B, C, D, E
- **Marks to the right** - Marks placed beside the option letters
- **Checkmarks (✓)** - Check symbols
- **Underlined options** - Underlined option letters
- **Other markings** - Any clear intentional marking

### 📊 Intelligent Scoring
- **Single Answer Questions**: Full credit (1.0) for correct answer, zero for wrong
- **Multiple Answer Questions**: Proportional scoring with penalties for wrong selections
  - Perfect match: 1.0 points
  - Partial correct: Proportional credit (e.g., 1 of 2 correct = 0.5 points)
  - Wrong selections: 0.5 point penalty per wrong answer
  - Final score: max(0, (correct - wrong×0.5) / total_correct)

## 🗄️ Database Schema

### Questions Table Enhancement
```sql
-- New column for multiple correct answers
ALTER TABLE questions ADD COLUMN correct_options JSON;

-- Backward compatibility examples:
-- Single correct answer:
INSERT INTO questions (paper_id, question_number, correct_option) VALUES (1, 1, 'A');

-- Multiple correct answers:
INSERT INTO questions (paper_id, question_number, correct_options) VALUES (1, 2, '["A", "C"]'::json);
```

## 🚀 Usage Examples

### API Request Format
```javascript
// Paper questions with mixed answer types
const questions = [
  {
    question_number: 1,
    correct_option: 'B',           // Single correct answer
    correct_options: null
  },
  {
    question_number: 2,
    correct_option: null,
    correct_options: ['A', 'C']    // Multiple correct answers
  }
];
```

### OMR Detection Response
```javascript
{
  "detected_answers": [
    {
      "question": 1,
      "selected_options": ["B"],
      "confidence": "high",
      "marking_type": "filled_circle"
    },
    {
      "question": 2,
      "selected_options": ["A", "C"],
      "confidence": "high",
      "marking_type": "marks_above"
    }
  ],
  "total_questions_found": 2,
  "image_quality": "good"
}
```

### Evaluation Results
```javascript
{
  "results": [
    {
      "question_number": 1,
      "student_answers": ["B"],
      "correct_answers": ["B"],
      "is_correct": true,
      "partial_score": 1,
      "evaluation_details": "Correct"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 2,
      "student_answers": ["A"],
      "correct_answers": ["A", "C"],
      "is_correct": false,
      "partial_score": 0.5,
      "evaluation_details": "Partial credit: 1/2 correct, 0 wrong"
    }
  ],
  "summary": {
    "total_score": 1.5,
    "max_score": 2,
    "percentage": 75,
    "grade": "B+"
  }
}
```

## 🧪 Testing Your Implementation

1. **Run the test suite:**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   node test-multiple-correct-omr.js
   ```

2. **Test with actual image:**
   - Add your `multiple-correct.png` image to the `backend/` folder
   - The test will automatically process it and show results

3. **Expected results for your image (Q1:b, Q2:a,c, Q3:a, Q4:d,e, Q5:a):**
   - Q1: Single answer B
   - Q2: Multiple answers A,C
   - Q3: Single answer A  
   - Q4: Multiple answers D,E
   - Q5: Single answer A

## 📝 Marking Style Examples

The system can detect these marking patterns:

```
Traditional Bubble Filling:
Q1:  (A) ●B● (C) (D) (E)

Marks Above Options:
Q2:   ✓   ✓
     A   B C D E

Marks to the Right:
Q3: A← B C D E

Checkmarks:
Q4: A B ✓C ✓D E

Mixed Styles:
Q5: ●A● B→ ✓C (D) E_
```

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables
```env
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
DATABASE_URL=your_postgres_database_url
```

### Confidence Levels
- **High**: Clear, unambiguous markings
- **Medium**: Somewhat clear markings
- **Low**: Questionable or faint markings

## ⚙️ Advanced Features

### Custom Scoring Rules
You can modify the scoring logic in `omrService.js`:
```javascript
// Adjust penalty for wrong answers (default: 0.5)
const WRONG_ANSWER_PENALTY = 0.5;

// Adjust minimum score threshold for "correct" (default: 0.8)
const CORRECT_THRESHOLD = 0.8;
```

### Performance Tuning
- Use JSONB instead of JSON for better indexing (optional)
- Add database indexes for frequently queried columns
- Implement caching for repeated evaluations

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
1. **Image Quality**: Ensure clear, well-lit images
2. **Marking Style**: Use consistent marking patterns
3. **Database Connection**: Verify PostgreSQL connection
4. **API Keys**: Check Gemini API key is valid

### Debug Mode:
Add console logging to see detection process:
```javascript
console.log('Detected answers:', detectionResult);
console.log('Evaluation results:', evaluationResult);
```

## 📊 Performance Metrics

From test results:
